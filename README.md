# BMO-Companion-Project
This is a personal project for creating an AI powered companion that mimics "BMO", a character from the hit Cartoon Network show "Adventure Time."


Involves STT, LLM response generation, TTS, LCD screen configuration + animations, game emulation, I/O features, and potential spotify/Bluetooth functionality.
The core aspect of the project is having BMO being able to communicate with users and play LCD animations when he speaks aswell as an idle animation.
Other none AI functionality as listed above + potentially more is also included go give more life to BMO.

Commit to finishing this.
